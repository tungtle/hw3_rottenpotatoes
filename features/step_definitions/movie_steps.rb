# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    # each returned element will be a hash whose key is the table header.
    # you should arrange to add that movie to the database here.
    if !Movie.exists?(:title => movie[:title])
      new_entry = Movie.new
      new_entry.title = movie[:title]
      new_entry.rating = movie[:rating]
      new_entry.release_date = movie[:release_date]
      new_entry.save
    end
  end
end

# Make sure that one string (regexp) occurs before or after another one
#   on the same page

Then /I should see "(.*)" before "(.*)"/ do |e1, e2|
  #  ensure that that e1 occurs before e2.
  #  page.body is the entire content of the page as a string.
  page.body.should =~ /#{e1}.*#{e2}/m
  # flunk "Unimplemented"
end

# Make it easier to express checking or unchecking several boxes at once
#  "When I uncheck the following ratings: PG, G, R"
#  "When I check the following ratings: G"

When /I (un)?check the following ratings: (.*)/ do |uncheck, rating_list|
  # HINT: use String#split to split up the rating_list, then
  #   iterate over the ratings and reuse the "When I check..." or
  #   "When I uncheck..." steps in lines 89-95 of web_steps.rb
  rating_list.split(", ").each do |rating|
    step %{I #{ uncheck ? 'un' : ''}check "ratings_#{rating}"}
  end
end

Then /I should see all of the movies/ do
  # puts page.all("table#movies tbody/tr")
  page.all("table#movies tbody/tr").count.should == Movie.count
